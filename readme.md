# what's this project?

a clean-room implementation of Huffman encoding, inspired by <br> ![animation from wikipedia](./res/Huffman_algorithm.gif) <br> which comes [here](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E9%9C%8D%E5%A4%AB%E6%9B%BC%E7%BC%96%E7%A0%81#/media/File:Huffman_algorithm.gif)

# todo

- [ ] map input symbols and calculate each symbol's weight
- [x] sort nodes' weight
- [x] one-pass traversing of various nodes' combination, in the order of ascending
- [x] one-pass reversed path traversing and output of various nodes
